@W: MT529 :"c:\code\tas\tas\tastable\fpga\top.v":25:4:25:9|Found inferred clock top|PACKAGEPIN which controls 16 sequential elements including arses.counter[14:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
