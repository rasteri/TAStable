@W: MT531 :"c:\code\tas\tas\tastable\fpga\top.v":238:4:238:9|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including arse.apusynclatched.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\code\tas\tas\tastable\fpga\top.v":25:4:25:9|Found inferred clock top|PACKAGEPIN which controls 26 sequential elements including arses.counter[14:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
